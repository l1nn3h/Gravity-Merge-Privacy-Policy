    </p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Gravity Merge 2048</strong> app (hereby referred to as 
      "Application") for mobile devices, created by <strong>Stillfire Games</strong> 
      (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a free service.

  <section>
    <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>
    <p>
        The Application itself does not collect personally identifiable information. 
        However, the Application uses third-party services that may collect certain 
        information automatically for the purpose of displaying advertisements, 
        measuring performance, and improving the service.
    </p>

    <p>The types of data that may be collected by third-party services include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertising ID</li>
        <li>Device information (such as device model, operating system, and hardware data)</li>
        <li>App interaction data and usage analytics</li>
        <li>Approximate location (derived from IP address)</li>
        <li>Diagnostic information such as crash logs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The Application uses the following third-party service:
        <br>
        • Google AdMob — <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>
    </p>

      No. The Application does not collect precise or approximate information about the 
      location of your mobile device.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h2>
    <p>
        Yes. The Application integrates Google AdMob to display advertisements. 
        AdMob may collect device identifiers, usage data, diagnostic information, and 
        other data as described in its own privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stillfire Games does not collect or store any personal information, nor does it 
        directly share any user data with third parties. Data collection and processing 
        performed by third-party services occurs under their own terms and privacy policies.

        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            Stillfire Games does not collect or retain any personal data from users of the 
            Application. Any data collected by third-party services such as Google AdMob is 
            handled, stored, and retained according to their respective privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users may manage or reset their device’s advertising ID and control ad 
            personalization preferences through their mobile device settings. 
            For example, Android allows users to restrict ad personalization or reset the 
            advertising ID at any time.
